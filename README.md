# No-Cash-Charity
Charity organization usually receives cash donation. There are several issues in this traditional way to run charity program.
1. Large amount of donation is not used for charity purpose, but running the organization.
2. The usage of the donation is not clear to donators.
3. No thrid party monitors the donation usage.

We are proposing a charity program without direct cash donation. Instead, when donation is needed to help people in trouble, a list of goods that are really in need is posted, so donator may directly make the purchase and get the goods delivered to the people in trouble.
